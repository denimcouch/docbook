# DocBook  

DocBook is a CLI app meant to provide developers with an easy way to write documentation locally. Users can create in-depth documentation using rich text and markdown as well as writing JavaScript code capable of bundling and executing in the browser! Under the hood, DocBook utilizes esbuild to execute the provided code. DocBook also supports imports via a custom esbuild plugin and unpkg.com.
